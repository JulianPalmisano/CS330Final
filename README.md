### How do I approach designing software?

When I design software, I start by understanding what the program is supposed to do and how the user will interact with it. For this project, my goal was to create a 2D animation that felt interactive rather than static. I focused on how objects move, collide, and respond to user input so the animation feels purposeful and engaging.

This project helped me improve my design skills by teaching me how to plan object behavior instead of just focusing on visuals. I learned how layout, color changes, and movement patterns can guide user attention and make interactions clearer. I followed a step-by-step design process, starting with a simple scene and gradually adding features like collision, physics, and controls. This approach made the project easier to manage and can be applied to future work by building and testing one feature at a time.

### How do I approach developing programs?

When developing programs, I focus on keeping the code organized and stable before adding complexity. I separated the program into clear components, such as circles for movement and bricks for interaction, which made the code easier to read and maintain. A new strategy I used was avoiding unnecessary libraries and only building on code that I knew worked.

Iteration was a major part of my development process. I made small changes, tested them, and adjusted the code based on the results. Over time, my approach to coding improved as I became more focused on structure and clarity instead of just making things work. By the end of the project, I was thinking more about long-term readability and reliability.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Working with computational graphics helped me better understand how math and logic translate into visual results. I gained experience with movement, collision detection, and real-time interaction, which are useful skills in many areas of computer science.

These skills are also valuable for my future career. Learning how to design interactive systems, manage object states, and debug visual programs has strengthened my problem-solving abilities. This project showed me how computer science can be used to create engaging, interactive applications and helped prepare me for more advanced projects in the future.
